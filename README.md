# 🐍 Python Laboratories

## Lab 1 - String Parser for Logical Functions 🧩
- Created a parser for logical functions.
- Checked for tautologies.
- Transforming logical functions to Reverse Polish Notation (RPN).

## Lab 2 - Continuation of Parser Work and Minimization of Logical Functions 🔄
- Minimized logical functions.
- Calculated logical functions based on input and output data.
- Used the Quine-McCluskey algorithm.
- Created an API for creating digital components (only input/output data had to be provided).

## Lab 3 - Python Generators 🔄
- Generated Fibonacci sequence 🐇
- Generated prime numbers 🔢
- Generated twin prime numbers 👯‍♂️
- Generated permutations of a sequence 🔀
- Generated combinations of a sequence 🔄
- Generated subsets of a sequence 🎚️

## Lab 4 - Digital Circuit Simulator and Networking in Python 🌐
- Created a digital circuit simulator using Python 🎛️
- Simulated basic logic gates like AND, OR, XOR, etc. 🚦
- Built a network communication system using sockets 🌐
- Implemented multi-threading for simultaneous tasks 🧵
- Created a GUI for the digital circuit simulator using Tkinter 🖥️

## Lab 5 - Rubik's Triangle ~~Cube~~ Game with Pygame🎮
- Developed a game using Python and Pygame 🐍
- Created a user interface for game interaction 🕹️
- User can play with settings like the size of the board, the number of colors, etc. 🎨

To solve that puzzle you need to have all triangles in one color.
You can change the color of the triangle by clicking on it.
When you click on a triangle, the color of the clicked triangle and the color of the adjacent triangles change.

## Lab 6 - AI for Connect Four Game with Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning 🎮
- Developed an AI for the Connect Four game using Python 🐍
- Implemented the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning for efficient decision-making 🧠
- Utilized a scoring system to evaluate the game board states 📊
- Created a user interface for game interaction 🕹️
- The AI evaluates the board and decides the best move based on the current state of the game 🤖
